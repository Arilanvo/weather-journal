# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras

If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## External Resources Used

I've got extrenal resources from many places

but I'll mention the cdns/tuts/refs/res's

I've used

1-Jquery
2-ajax
3-bootstrap navbar "starter code"
4-ESLint.org
5-stackoverflow
6-w3schools
7-MDN
8-Youtube
9-SocialMedia
10-knowledge.udacity.com/questions/60349 points to my classroom classroom.udacity.com/me
11-packages.json "npm polyfill" for smooth scrolling
12-Github
13-Codepen

I've got help from various youtube videos too as explination and more.

## Development Strategy

- at first I've used the skeleton given by udacity but then I've decided to build from scratch because I felt this will be more comfy to me than being confused between two codes mine and the original.

"I've built the responsive navbar and used Javascript to create eventlistener for scrolling and click highlighting."

- sorry I'm not experienced to be able to work under intensive pressure of two codes mixed.

- finally, I've decided to merge between my work and skeleton work to improve my skills.

## B.S: to start use "Node server.js" in the terminal

## B.S: Please use U.S Zip code I've used "11799" in Firefox dev Edition and it worked perfectly fine
